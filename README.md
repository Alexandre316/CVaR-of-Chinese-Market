# Conditional Value at Risk

## What is CVaR?

The original intention of Conditional Value at Risk is to decentralize and supervise the overall risks among large asset portfolios. In the actual market, the return rate of large assets usually shows the characteristics of "peak" and "thick tail", and the return rate of each asset does not conform to the assumption of multivariate normal distribution, and the tail extreme value is correlated. Therefore, it is considered to use t-copula to characterize the tail correlation of assets and reconstruct the tail distribution of asset return.
